            <b>Strategy</b> allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.<br/>
            Example from Java SE API:
            <ul>               
                <li>java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().</li>
                <li>javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, the service() and all doXXX() methods take HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse and the implementor has to process them (and not to get hold of them as instance variables!).</li>
                <li>javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()</li>              
            </ul>
        </div>
